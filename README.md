distance1D
==========

Program for phylogenetic calculations using SDS electrophoresis results

Perl Tk required.
The program does not need installation, just run a copy. In Linux systems it should be set as executable (chmod +x distance1D.pl).

The user input is two paths to the files. The files should contain molecular weight and abundance of the protein separated with semicolon “:”. MW should be in KDa and abundance should be 1 to 5 (1-low, 5-high expression of the protein). Blank lines and lines started with # are ignored.
